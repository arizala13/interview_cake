# --- general notes ---
# Question: Given list of integers
# find the highest product you can get
# from three integers
# Runtime: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

def highest_product_of_3(list_of_ints):
    # highest =
    # lowest =
    # high_product_of_2 =
    # low_product_of_2 =
    return highest_product_of_3

highest_product_of_3([1, 2, 3, -40])

# way to approach this is greedy algo
# take product of two highest values multiple
# same for lowest
# then try the 3rd number with both and save that if
# it is larger, continue to do so till the end is reached
# so at the end you have two values, take the max of that
