# --- general notes ---
# Question: return a list of all the products of the
# list except for that integer at that index
# ex: [1, 7, 3, 4] -> [84, 12, 28, 21]
#
# Runtime:
# Space complexity:

def product_of_all(list_given):
    # new array to save all answers
    answer = []

    # start pointer

    # used to save the product of the values to the left of n

    # used to save the product of the values to the right of n




    return answer


product_of_all([1, 7, 3, 4])


# how to solve this?
# look at n to end of list and multiply
# look at start of list to n multiply that
# multiply product_left * product_right
# insert that in the correct place
